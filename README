== A quick-n-dirty visualizer for Makefiles ==

DISCLAIMER: I've spent an hour to visualize the Makefile I needed. 
            So, sorry if it won't work for you.

=== DESCRIPTION ===
makefile2dot has been written to visualize Makefiles, e.g. GNU make Makefile. 
It is written in Python and implies that you have Python and GraphViz "dot" utility installed:

sudo apt-get install graphviz
sudo apt-get install python


=== Download ===

    sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/makefile2dot.py https://raw.github.com/miebach/makefile2dot/master/makefile2dot.py
    sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/makefile2dot.py
  

=== USAGE ===

	makefile2dot.py <Makefile >out.dot
or
